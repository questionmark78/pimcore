# Assets

Assets are files that can be managed within the Pimcore system which you can organize in folders. The most common assets 
are images. Other kinds of common assets are PDF or MS Word documents which people can download from the website.
Pimcore is able to render preview images for most file types. 

##### Following file types are supported for preview: 
* Images: All common formats such as .jpg, .png, .eps, .psd, .tif, .svg, ... (See [Imagemagick website](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php) for a full list of supported formats)
* Videos: All common formats such as .avi, .mp4, .mkv, .mov, ... (See [FFmpeg website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats) for a full list of supported formats)
* Documents: All Microsoft Office formats such as .docx, .docm, .pptx, .xlsx and formats such as .pdf, .rtf, ... (See [LibreOffice documentation](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/1/13/1_-_File_Formats.odt) for a full list of supported formats)

> Please note: The asset preview tab for documents uses Google services, if the client browser has no PDF 
> displaying capabilities and Ghostscript or LibreOffice are not available on the server.

Some file types, like images, can be edited directly in Pimcore and can be used to create thumbnails for different 
output channels. Note that the image editor does use the [miniPaint image editor](https://github.com/viliusle/miniPaint) under the hood.

As Asset documents depend on background processes to generate thumbnails and search text, these processes require page count processing.
Occasionally, this results in the consumption of unnecessary processing resources, even when the feature is not extensively used.
In such situations, it is possible to disable the background processing as follows:
```yaml
pimcore:
    assets:
        document:
            thumbnails:
                enabled: false #disable generating thumbnail for asset documents
            process_page_count: false #disable processing page count
            process_text: false #disable processing text extraction
            scan_pdf: false #disable scanning PDF documents for unsafe JavaScript.
```
